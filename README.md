- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Kapetan-Migas
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in suggestions for the Slicer editing developers.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m a musician and painter and Love using my SL-20. Even though I consider it a fantastic tool already, I always lamented the fact that the user can't edit his/her own patterns primaraly and secondarily create patterns with odd meters. So when I learned about the pattern editing tool I was elated. And even more elated with the possibility to make some suggestions that can enhance the SLICERS features and playability...IF possible of course.
